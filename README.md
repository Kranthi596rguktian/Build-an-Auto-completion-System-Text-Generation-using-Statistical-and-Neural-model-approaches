# Build-an-Auto-completion-System-Text-Generation-using-Statistical-and-Neural-model-approaches
Successfully predict the upcoming word by giving two previous words using probabilistic technique and find out the drawbacks and  move to a Neural Language model, particularly with the LSTM architecture with Pytorch frame work.

Suggested to run the code in google colab. It has already pre installed all the required libraries for this code .
